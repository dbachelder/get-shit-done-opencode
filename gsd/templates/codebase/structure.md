# Structure Template

Template for `.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md` - captures physical file organization.

**Purpose:** Document where things physically live in the codebase. Answers "where do I put X?"

---

## File Template

```markdown
# Codebase Structure

**Analysis Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Directory Layout

[ASCII tree of top-level directories with purpose]

```
[project-root]/
├── [dir]/          # [Purpose]
├── [dir]/          # [Purpose]
├── [dir]/          # [Purpose]
└── [file]          # [Purpose]
```

## Directory Purposes

**[Directory Name]:**
- Purpose: [What lives here]
- Contains: [Types of files: e.g., "*.ts source files", "component directories"]
- Key files: [Important files in this directory]
- Subdirectories: [If nested, describe structure]

**[Directory Name]:**
- Purpose: [What lives here]
- Contains: [Types of files]
- Key files: [Important files]
- Subdirectories: [Structure]

## Key File Locations

**Entry Points:**
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "CLI entry point"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Server startup"]

**Configuration:**
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "TypeScript config"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Build configuration"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Environment variables"]

**Core Logic:**
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Business services"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Database models"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "API routes"]

**Testing:**
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Unit tests"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Test fixtures"]

**Documentation:**
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "User-facing docs"]
- [Path]: [Purpose: e.g., "Developer guide"]

## Naming Conventions

**Files:**
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "kebab-case.ts for modules"]
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "PascalCase.tsx for React components"]
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "*.test.ts for test files"]

**Directories:**
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "kebab-case for feature directories"]
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "plural names for collections"]

**Special Patterns:**
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "index.ts for directory exports"]
- [Pattern]: [Example: e.g., "__tests__ for test directories"]

## Where to Add New Code

**New Feature:**
- Primary code: [Directory path]
- Tests: [Directory path]
- Config if needed: [Directory path]

**New Component/Module:**
- Implementation: [Directory path]
- Types: [Directory path]
- Tests: [Directory path]

**New Route/Command:**
- Definition: [Directory path]
- Handler: [Directory path]
- Tests: [Directory path]

**Utilities:**
- Shared helpers: [Directory path]
- Type definitions: [Directory path]

## Special Directories

[Any directories with special meaning or generation]

**[Directory]:**
- Purpose: [e.g., "Generated code", "Build output"]
- Source: [e.g., "Auto-generated by X", "Build artifacts"]
- Committed: [Yes/No - in .gitignore?]

*Update when directory structure changes*

## Guidelines

**What belongs in STRUCTURE.md:**
- Directory layout (ASCII tree)
- Purpose of each directory
- Key file locations (entry points, configs, core logic)
- Naming conventions
- Where to add new code (by type)
- Special/generated directories

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Conceptual architecture (that's ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Technology stack (that's STACK.md)
- Code implementation details (defer to code reading)
- Every single file (focus on directories and key files)

**When filling this template:**
- Use `tree -L 2` or similar to visualize structure
- Identify top-level directories and their purposes
- Note naming patterns by observing existing files
- Locate entry points, configs, and main logic areas
- Keep directory tree concise (max 2-3 levels)

**ASCII tree format:**
```
root/
├── dir1/           # Purpose
│   ├── subdir/    # Purpose
│   └── file.ts    # Purpose
├── dir2/          # Purpose
└── file.ts        # Purpose
```

**Useful for phase planning when:**
- Adding new features (where should files go?)
- Understanding project organization
- Finding where specific logic lives
- Following existing conventions
